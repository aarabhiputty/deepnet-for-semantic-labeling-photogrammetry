# DeepNet-for-Semantic-Labeling-Photogrammetry-
automated extraction of urban objects from data acquired by airborne sensors which very high-resolution data,  leads to high intra-class variance while the inter-class variance is low, focus is on detailed 2D semantic segmentation that assigns labels to multiple object categories.
